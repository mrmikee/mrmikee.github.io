I used a wire to connect ground from accross the board.\n Case As always I have to find another reason to justify the purchase of my 3D printer. So I searched Thingiverse and found where \u0026ldquo;Spiritdude\u0026rdquo; had already created a nice case for the D1 Mini board, but the sensor location created problems for the left side mouting location, so I imported the STL file into SketchUp and moved the leg more to the top of the case.\nHere is my modified version of Spiritdude\u0026rsquo;s case if you want to print your own.\n Software Here is my \u0026ldquo;Home Assistant ESP-Home\u0026rdquo; yaml config file for the Multi-Sensor.\nesphome: name: attic_multisensor_01 platform: ESP8266 board: d1_mini wifi: ssid: !secret wifi_ssid password: !secret wifi_pass captive_portal: # Enable logging logger: # Enable Home Assistant API api: # Enable Over The Air updates ota: # Create BME Sensor on I2C i2c: sda: D6 scl: D7 # Scan I2C address to look for sensors scan: True sensor: - platform: bme280 # Default address 0x77 address: 0x76 temperature: name: \u0026quot;Attic Temperature\u0026quot; id: attic_bme280_temperature filters: - lambda: return x * (9.0/5.0) + 32.0; unit_of_measurement: \u0026quot;°F\u0026quot; pressure: name: \u0026quot;Attic Pressure\u0026quot; id: attic_bme280_pressure humidity: name: \u0026quot;Attic Humidity\u0026quot; id: attic_bme280_humidity filters: - calibrate_linear: # Map 0.0 (from sensor) to 0.0 (true value) - 0.0 -\u0026gt; 0.0 - 32.7 -\u0026gt; 55.7 update_interval: 15s  ","date":1577882634,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577882634,"objectID":"f2ac5d4c0d6753814a522ee52b14c839","permalink":"https://www.mikecone.us/post/home_projects/esp_tmp_humid_sensor/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T12:43:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/home_projects/esp_tmp_humid_sensor/","section":"post","summary":"WiFi Temp Humidity and Pressure monitoring with ESP8266","tags":["Home Automation","esp8266","3d print"],"title":"ESP8266 Temp Multi-Sensor","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["IOT"],"content":"I built a second WiFi sensor, this time for my aquarium to monitor the tank water temperature.\nThis like my Attic Multi-Sensor uses the home automation software Home Assistant with the EspHome plugin.\nInstead of reinventing the wheel, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to refer you to the great Dallas Temperature documentation at the ESPHome website for this sensor for you to see how I went about building mine.\nHere is a screenshot of of my water temperature sensor\u0026rsquo;s graph in Home Assistant:\n Hardware   Wemos D1 Mini clone  DS18N20 temp sensor   Case Here are my aquarium sensor case 3D print files and some images below of how the one I built looks.\n Software Here is my \u0026ldquo;Home Assistant : ESP-Home\u0026rdquo; yaml config file for my aquarium temp sensor.\n# D1-Mini CLONE w/attached DS18N20 waterproof Temp probe # substitutions: devicename: aquarium_temp_01 upper_devicename: Aquarium 20gal esphome: name: ${devicename} platform: ESP8266 board: d1_mini wifi: ssid: !secret wifi_ssid password: !secret wifi_pass # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails ap: ssid: \u0026quot;${devicename}\u0026quot; password: !secret ap_fallback_pwd captive_portal: # Enable logging logger: # Enable Home Assistant API api: # Enable Over The Air updates ota: safe_mode: True # Example configuration entry dallas: - pin: GPIO4 update_interval: 15s sensor: - platform: dallas address: 0xCE041662D2CFFF28 name: ${devicename}_temp filters: - lambda: return x * (9.0/5.0) + 32.0; unit_of_measurement: \u0026quot;°F\u0026quot; - platform: wifi_signal name: ${devicename}_wifi_signal update_interval: 30s - platform: uptime name: ${devicename}_uptime binary_sensor: - platform: status name: ${upper_devicename} Status id: ${devicename}_status text_sensor: - platform: version name: ${devicename}_esphome_version  ","date":1577882634,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577882634,"objectID":"4dc95dfaa595c781b517a41ea1d65e20","permalink":"https://www.mikecone.us/post/home_projects/esp_aquarium_temp_sensor/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T12:43:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/home_projects/esp_aquarium_temp_sensor/","section":"post","summary":"Monitor water temperature in my aquarium.","tags":["Home Automation","esp8266","3d print"],"title":"WiFi Aquarium Water Temp Sensor","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"For a while now my father has been after me to help him build a system that will allow him to remotely operate his ham radio shack.
