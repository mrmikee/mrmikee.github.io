If this winds up helping someone else then that is just the \u0026ldquo;icing on the cake\u0026rdquo; as they say.\nI wanted to learn more about PXE booting before getting started with Ubuntu MASS. I did this to have a better understanding of the underlying technologies. My ultimate goal is to autoinstall Ubuntu Server on Bare Metal (HP-T620\u0026rsquo;s) for my home lab Kubernetes cluster Ansbile deployment. I wanted a way to auto install everything from bare metal to the K8\u0026rsquo;s pods so I could \u0026ldquo;refresh\u0026rdquo; the cluster at anytime after I messed something up while learning clustered K8s.\nI thought about using one of my many Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s as my PXE boot server, but in the end I had already built a small HP EliteDesk running Ubuntu 20.04 to mirror the Ubuntu package repositories so that I could cut down on my internet data usage, so I used that machine instead.\nOn my network, the PXE boot functions are split between two machines. The first is my router that runs Pfsense and the second is the apt-mirror machine I mentioned earlier.\nHosts and function:\n pfsense : DHCP, DNS apt-mirror: TFTP, HTTP  TFTP config Prep the system tftpd-hpa is the tftp service, pxelinux is a bootloader member of the syslinux family, and is built for the PXE environment, the syslinux-efi package contains libraries needed to support EFI clients.\n# become root on your TFTP server sudo su apt install syslinux-common syslinux-efi pxelinux tftpd-hpa mkdir -p /tftpboot/{bios,efi32,efi64,boot,iso,pxelinux.cfg} cd /tftpboot ln -rs pxelinux.cfg bios \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ln -rs pxelinux.cfg efi32 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ln -rs pxelinux.cfg efi64 ln -rs boot bios \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ln -rs boot efi32 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ln -rs boot efi64 # BIOS files cp /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/{ldlinux,vesamenu,libcom32,libutil}.c32 /tftpboot/bios cp /usr/lib/PXELINUX/pxelinux.0 /tftpboot/bios # UEFI-32 files cp /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi32/ldlinux.e32 /tftpboot/efi32 cp /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi32/{vesamenu,libcom32,libutil}.c32 /tftpboot/efi32 cp /usr/lib/SYSLINUX.EFI/efi32/syslinux.efi /tftpboot/efi32 # UEFI-64 files cp /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/ldlinux.e64 /tftpboot/efi64 cp /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/{vesamenu,libcom32,libutil}.c32 /tftpboot/efi64 cp /usr/lib/SYSLINUX.EFI/efi64/syslinux.efi /tftpboot/efi64 # confirm port 69 is ALLOWED on local firewall ufw status # if ufw (micro firewall) is active and 69 is not allowed then: # ufw allow 69  # tree view of tftpboot folder contents: tftpboot ├── bios │ ├── codewall.png │ ├── ldlinux.c32 │ ├── libcom32.c32 │ ├── libutil.c32 │ ├── pxelinux.0 │ ├── pxelinux.cfg -\u0026gt; ../pxelinux.cfg │ └── vesamenu.c32 ├── boot │ ├── ... ├── efi32 │ ├── codewall.png │ ├── ldlinux.e32 │ ├── libcom32.c32 │ ├── libutil.c32 │ ├── pxelinux.cfg -\u0026gt; ../pxelinux.cfg │ ├── syslinux.efi │ └── vesamenu.c32 ├── efi64 │ ├── codewall.png │ ├── grub.cfg │ ├── ldlinux.e64 │ ├── libcom32.c32 │ ├── libutil.c32 │ ├── pxelinux.cfg -\u0026gt; ../pxelinux.cfg │ ├── syslinux.efi │ └── vesamenu.c32 ├── iso │ ├── ... └── pxelinux.cfg └── default  NOTE: I have set a menu background \u0026ldquo;codewall.png\u0026rdquo; that I modified 3 copies of.

My dad wanted a media player to play his recorded shows that were saved on his NAS, but he wanted to play them on his den tv. That\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to setup if you just live across town from each other, but we are a 5 hour drive apart. So I decided to take advantage of our site to site VPN.

A missing ADMIN user that was not created on install for some reason.\n create Admin acct  HowTo scroll down to the section on setup Kube Daskboard.\nCreate a file called: dashboard-adminuser.yaml --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: admin-user namespace: kube-system --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: admin-user roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: cluster-admin subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: admin-user namespace: kube-system  Apply the configuration with KubeCtl: kubectl apply -f ~/Projects/k8s-cluster/dashboard-adminuser.yaml\nGet the Token for the newly created user: kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $(kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep admin-user | awk '{print $1}')\nNow just paste the token into the k8s Dashboard login screen under the \u0026ldquo;token\u0026rdquo; option.\nDONE!  At least I thought I was done.\nWork VPN issues This should not apply to you.\nAs I have more than one private network on my LAN, when I activate my work VPN it only allows local traffic on one of my subnets. So to be able to reach the k8s cluster in the other private IP space while the work VPN client is \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo;, I have to use a \u0026ldquo;bastion host\u0026rdquo; on my laptop\u0026rsquo;s subnet that can also \u0026ldquo;talk\u0026rdquo; to the cluster\u0026rsquo;s network.\nTo view k8s dashboard while connected to work VPN I have to: # create local tunnel using a bastion server ssh -L 6443:10.20.30.3:6443 192.168.9.107 -N # ------------- # now I can open the k8s Dashboard on my laptop: # # when VPN is active. # - https://localhost:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy # # when VPN is NOT active: # - - https://10.20.30.3:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy  ","date":1563495120,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563495120,"objectID":"a91b6874f2f3caace86d3bbf07828c88","permalink":"https://www.mikecone.us/post/home_projects/t620_kubernetes-cluster/","publishdate":"2019-07-19T00:12:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/home_projects/t620_kubernetes-cluster/","section":"post","summary":"Using Ansible to build Kubernetes on 5 HP t620+ thin clients!","tags":["K8s","Ansible"],"title":"ConeNet Kubernetes","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"While researching Ansible and how to use it for a project at work, I watched this video from Jeff Geerling and I had to build my own Raspberry Pi cluster.\nThen I thought why not get the kids involved and make this one a family project instead.\n Here\u0026rsquo;s my son helping assemble the cluster. The poor guy had fallen on the playground at school and broken his arm.\nMy kids with the assembled cluster before wiring.\nUsing some perf board and my soldering iron I put together some multi-colored leds to control via Ansible playbooks.\nLeds installed.\nNo project should be without a case!\nKey Features  Stand Alone. Requires no internet connection once software is installed. Great for giving demos. Single power supply for the entire cluster including networking. Clutter is reduced. WiFi Client for using in demos and talks. (TP-Link WR702N) Easy to transport and store Can connect to the Internet when needed via Ethernet cable or Wifi.  Components The items I used to build my cluster are mostly still available, here is the Amazon Wish List that I created when I was building mine.\nNote: I did modify the power cables so that each USB power port powers 2 of the Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s.
