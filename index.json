My dad wanted a media player to play his recorded shows that were saved on his NAS, but he wanted to play them on his den tv. That\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to setup if you just live across town from each other, but we are a 5 hour drive apart. So I decided to take advantage of our site to site VPN. I setup a OpenVPN in our routers a few years back so I could have an off site backup of our kids photos without using the \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo;.\nProblem I started this by trying the VNC server included with Raspbian, I was dissapointed to discover that when Kodi launched all I got was a black screen. Turns out Kodi doesn\u0026rsquo;t uses X11 at all so the video was not \u0026ldquo;redirected\u0026rdquo; across the VNC connection.\nThe solution Using a different VNC server called dispmanx_vnc and NOT running the GUI at all.\nI found inspiration on the VNC server setup from this OSMC Support Article.\nSteps I took on Raspbian # ssh into the RPi # disable the GUI sudo rasbpi-config # install the compiler to build the code into an executable sudo apt-get install build-essential libvncserver-dev libconfig++-dev unzip # download and unpack the VNC source code wget https://github.com/patrikolausson/dispmanx_vnc/archive/master.zip # unzip the compressed file unzip master.zip # change to the source code folder cd dispmanx_vnc-master/ # compile the source into a binary by running make make # DONE!  While I didn\u0026rsquo;t install a LAMP stack nor did I completely follow his steps, I did find great information from Leow Kah Man\u0026rsquo;s blog.\nYou can read how to:\n \u0026ldquo;Disable booting to desktop\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Installing Kodi\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Run Kodi on startup\u0026rdquo;  # Run Kodi on startup sudo crontab -e @reboot kodi --standalone  Secret revealed! Now while it was not necessary, I was actually using a Magewell HDMI to USB capture device and Team Viewer to view the HDMI output of the Raspberry Pi so I could confirm what was being sent from the RPi to the TV was the same I was seeing in the VNC client.\n ","date":1588459434,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588459434,"objectID":"27837d7a8f5037212e26ab1494e8c72b","permalink":"https://www.mikecone.us/post/home_projects/kodi_install_over_vnc/","publishdate":"2020-05-02T22:43:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/home_projects/kodi_install_over_vnc/","section":"post","summary":"Using ssh, VNC, and OpenVPN to install Kodi on my dad's Raspberry Pi from 245 miles away.
